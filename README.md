# CPUs

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-93.5%25-brightgreen)

`cpus` is a small Go module for dealing with CPU lists and sets, as used
throughout several places in Linux, such as syscalls and `procfs` pseudo files.
It has been carved out from the [lxkns](https://github.com/thediveo/lxkns)
project as it is useful in applications, tools, and tests beyond lxkns.
